In this project, i uesed Python to explore data related to bike sharing systems for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York, and Washington. I have written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics. I have also written a script that takes raw inputs to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
